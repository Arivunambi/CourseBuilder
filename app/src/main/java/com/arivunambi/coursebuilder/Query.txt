All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources. For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.","text",24),

insert into article_media values("","           Early computers were built to perform a series of single tasks, like a calculator. Basic operating system features were developed in the 1950s, such as resident monitor functions that could automatically run different programs in succession to speed up processing. Operating systems did not exist in their modern and more complex forms until the early 1960s. Hardware features were added, that enabled use of runtime libraries, interrupts, and parallel processing. When personal computers became popular in the 1980s, operating systems were made for them similar in concept to those used on larger computers. In the 1940s, the earliest electronic digital systems had no operating systems. Electronic systems of this time were programmed on rows of mechanical switches or by jumper wires on plug boards. These were special-purpose systems that, for example, generated ballistics tables for the military or controlled the printing of payroll checks from data on punched paper cards. After programmable general purpose computers were invented, machine languages (consisting of strings of the binary digits 0 and 1 on punched paper tape) were introduced that speed up the programming process (Stern, 1981).","text",25),

insert into article_media values("","           Operating systems are classified as follows<br/>1. Multi-user:  Allows two or more users to run programs at the same time. Some operating systems permit hundreds or even thousands of concurrent users.<br/>2. Multiprocessing : Supports running a program on more than one CPU.<br/>3. Multitasking : Allows more than one program to run concurrently.<br/>4. Multithreading : Allows different parts of a single program to run concurrently.<br/>5. Real time: Responds to input instantly. General-purpose operating systems, such as DOS and UNIX, are not real-time.","text",26),
